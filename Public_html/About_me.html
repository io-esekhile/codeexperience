    <p>
        Hello there! I'm Alex, a passionate 3D artist with a keen<br> 
        eye for aesthetics and a heart full of creativity. I've dedicated<br> 
        myself to sculpting, texturing, and animating in the enchanting<br> 
        world of three-dimensional art. But my journey doesn't stop at<br> 
        sculpting; I'm also on an exciting mission to delve into the<br> 
        captivating realm of coding.
    </p>
    <p>

        The fusion of art and technology is where I find my true calling.<br> 
        It's about transforming my 3D visions into interactive and<br> 
        functional digital marvels. I've embarked on this incredible<br> 
        journey to learn the language of code.<br>
